Small implementation of a Huffman compression algorithm.  By no means is the most efficient implementation, as it
does not use an adaptive Huffman coding, and thus needs to count all characters in a file before apply compression. 
I wrote it to gain a better of understanding of how basic compression techniques work. 

Usage
Take a look at Main.cs in the Driver folder.  Simply pass an ASCII text file into the constructor as well as a
path to the generated huffman tree file which contains the encodings (I have chosen .hdef for the extension of the
encoding file).  The Encode method will return the stream of compressed bytes.

To uncompress the bytes, extract the bytes from the file and pass them in to the Decode method, which will then
return the full text output of the compressed file.
